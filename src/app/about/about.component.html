                            This ancient Ganesha Temple is also known as Kanipakam Vinayaka Temple. The Prime deity of this
                            Temple is Sri Varasiddhi Vinayaka Swamy is a swayambhu, self-manifested idol. A very interesting
                            fact is associated with this temple is that Sri Vinayaka Idol size is increasing day by day.
                            It is believed that the idol will be growing in size until the end of Kaliyuga and then Sri Vinayaka
                            will appear in person. The well from where Sri Varasiddhi Vinayaka manifested is still exist
                            in the temple. The holy water from the well is distributed among the devotees as prasadam in
                            this temple.&nbsp;The Temple is believed to be more than 800 years’ old which was constructed
                            in the early 11th century CE by the Chola king Kulothunga Chola-I. The name of the present Kanipakam
                            village in olden days was called “Viharapuri”.</span>

                          <span>Legends as per the legend of the ancient temple, there were three brothers and each of them had
                            a handicap. One day, they started digging the well for water and suddenly the Iron implement
                            hit a stone like structure. Later, they saw the blood oozing out from the well which made the
                            entire water in the well to turn red. On observing this divine sight, they got rid of their deformities.
                            As soon as the locals came to know about this miracle they tried to deepen the well further.</span>

                          <span>The "Swayambhu" idol of Sri Varasiddi Vinayaka emerged from the well. Later, people built a temple
                            around the well. Even today, the idol is in the original well and the springs of the well are
                            perpetual. The holy water from the well overflows during rainy season. Another strange feature
                            of the idol is that it is still growing in size. It is believed that swayambhu idol of Sri Varasiddi
                            Vinayaka is the up-holder of truth. The disputes among the people are resolved by taking an oath.
                            It is a regular practice for the people of this region to take a holy dip in the temple tank
                            and swear before the lord to prove their innocence.</span>
